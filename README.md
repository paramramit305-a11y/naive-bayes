# Naive Bayes – Learning Implementation (Prime AI ML Batch)

This repository contains my **learning implementation of Naive Bayes** algorithm as part of my Machine Learning journey.

This is NOT a large or production-level project.  
It is a **practice / learning notebook** created while studying Machine Learning concepts.

---

## 🚀 About This

In this notebook, I learned and implemented **Naive Bayes Classification** from scratch understanding:

- Probabilistic approach in ML
- Bayes Theorem intuition
- Conditional probability
- Feature independence assumption
- Classification logic (Yes / No prediction)

The implementation was done in **Jupyter Notebook** using Python and Scikit-Learn.
